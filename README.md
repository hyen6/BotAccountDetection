# BotAccountDetection
## 1. Abstract (Motivation) 
Bots are software programs designed to perform tasks automatically, and they are commonly used on social media platforms like Twitter to carry out simple actions. However, there have been several reports indicating that bot voting practices have led to manipulated outcomes in data science competitions. Therefore, it has become crucial for the research community to develop classification models for detecting bot accounts. This project aims to address this issue by using a dataset available on Kaggle that includes information on bot accounts. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to gain insights into the characteristics and behavior of bot accounts, which can help us develop effective methods for detecting them in the future.
## 2. Introduction (Problem Description)
Data science competitions on online platforms like Kaggle have become increasingly popular in recent years, attracting participants from all over the world. However, there have been concerns about the manipulation of these competitions through the use of automated accounts, or bots. Bot accounts can be used to artificially inflate scores and rankings, undermining the integrity of the competition, and hindering the progress of the research community. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop effective methods for detecting bot accounts in data science competitions. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Kaggle user accounts as either bot or human. The dataset we will be using contains information on approximately 1.3 million Kaggle accounts, including the number of scripts and kernels created, the number of competitions participated in, and the creation date of the account. By analyzing this dataset and developing an accurate bot detection model, we hope to contribute to the development of more reliable methods for detecting bots in data science competitions and ensure the fairness and integrity of these competitions.
